# Adventure Game Made in Python
A revised version of the Adventure Game made in Python that I have made in the past. 
A full description of what the program will do will be written when the base or skeleton has been finished.

What has been completed:
A basic items class with a few items

# Working on:
Main Game
Need to redo player_menu() due to bugs with enemy.hp. Breaking the loop down into smaller functions may be the way to go.
Player contract consistency


# To do:
Random Map Generation
